/************ Sorting Algorithm : Insertion Sort **********************
 *
 * #GENERAL:
 * The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.
 * Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
 * The performance of the algorithm in worst case:
 * (n is the array size)
 *
 * #ALGORITHM:
 * 1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.
 * 2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
 * 3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
 *
 * #USES:
 * Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small.
 * It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.
 *
 * #COMPARISONS:
 * No. of comparisons = 1 + 2 + 3+.....n-1= n(n-1)/2 [O(n^2)]
 * No. of swaps = 1 + 2 + 3 +......n-1 = n(n-1)/2 [O(n^2)]
 *
 * #TIME/SPACE COMPLEXITIES:
 * Worst Case Time Complexity : O(n^2) [^ => Exponentiation]
 * Best Case Time Complexity : O(n^2)
 * Auxiliary Space: O(1) [Since No Extra Space is Used] (In Place)
 *
 * #RECURSION:
 * Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages, but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Insertion Sort and recursion.
 *
 * #RECURSION IDEA:
 * Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return.
 * Recursively sort first n-1 elements.
 * Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array.
 *
 * #BOUNDARY CASE:
 * Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in REVERSE order to what is intended.
 * And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.
