*/

/*
The idea here is the implementation of a circular FIFO queue.
The reason being, both the programs (0x1 and 0x2) that were not using circular FIFO, were facing serious problems.

- We were not able to utilise the emptied out portions in the queue even after dequeueing, and also, at some point the queue turned out to be
overflow and underflow at the same time, weird.

This is solved by using a circular queue..

Look at this equation

REAR  = (( REAR  +1 )  % SIZE)
FRONT = (( FRONT +1 )  % SIZE)

Imagine an array of size 5, with 5 elements in it. Now let's assume REAR & FRONT point at index zero.
    We want to increment REAR, after adding an element to the queue, let's use the above metioned equation.
    REAR  = (( REAR  +1 )  % SIZE)
    we get ((0 +1) % 5) == 1
    (repeat this till REAR == 3, i.e for 4 elements)

    Now, when REAR is equal to 4. That is, the fifth element, (((4+1) % 5) == 0 )
    Notice 0.
    This means now the REAR is pointing back at the zeroth index. In a circular fashion.
    Same applies for FRONT.

NOTE - the only concrete idea that we have to keep in mind is in this method, the rear & front will start at SIZE-1 (i.e the last index) - You should know why. If not
I urge you to dry run the algorithm on a notebook and check.

    if(REAR == (SIZE -1))
    {
        REAR = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        REAR++;
    }
