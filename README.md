# DS-and-Algo
A collection of data structures &amp; algorithms

We are planning to increase the languages supported by this project.

- Currently we have people working in C/C++ and Python. We need more people with skills in Java, Javascript, Rust, haskell etc.
- Look around in the C project and check out the template that we follow, it's basically First pseudocode and then actual Code, so that anyone venturing here can understand what is going on in the code, nothing here is intended to be cryptic, every single line of code has been commented well enough.

If you are willing to contribute-

1. Find something in a language that suits you.
2. Fork the project.
3. Clone.
4. Create a branch.
5. Make your additions/changes.
6. Commit & push your changes.
7. Create a pull request.
