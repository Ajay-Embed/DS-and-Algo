# DataStructures-Algorithms
A collection of data structures &amp; algorithms

We are planning to increase the languages supported by this project.

- Currently we have people working in C/C++ and Python. We need more people with skills in Java, Rust etc.

- Look around in the C project and check out the template that we follow, it's basically First pseudocode and then actual Code, so that anyone venturing here can understand what is going on in the code, nothing here is intended to be cryptic, every single line of code has been commented well enough.

If you are willing to contribute-

1. Find something in a language that suits you.
2. Fork the project.
3. Clone.
4. Create a branch.
5. Make your additions/changes.
6. Commit & push your changes.
7. Create a pull request.

We will review it the first time and if needed, add some comments. It is hard to follow rules but in order to become understandable & easy, they must be followed.
Once you are a part of the contributors, any code that is pushed by any member, will have to be reviewed by you or the assigned reviewers. 

Currently we have the following members contributing -
- Ajay Rajan (Embedded Software Engineer)                     ajaycrajan@gmail.com
- Pranjal Shrivastava (Embedded Software Engineer)            pranshri0506@gmail.com
- Shivam Ranjan (Frontend Developer)                          shivamranjan87@gmail.com
